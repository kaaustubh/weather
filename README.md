# weather
1. The App is built using Xcode v9.4.1
2. VIPER Architecture
3. Swift version- 4.1.2
4. Run pod install in the root folder
5. On successful pod install, open Weather.xcworkspace
6. It should run seemlessly on Simulator, if not clean(Command+Shift+k)) and Run again

Things Missed:
1. Error Handling
2. A nice UX :(
3. The New swift features may be(since it has been a long time I have worked on swift)
